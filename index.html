        <p> Hello! My name is Paolo Gonzales. I am from Calgary, Alberta in Canada. The photo on this site is of me at Lake Morraine in Banff Alberta. Its an amazing lake that has beautiful blue water as a result of sediment runoff from the surrrounding mountains. I love hiking and rock climbing! I will often spend much of my time with my family exploring the rocky mountains. </p>
